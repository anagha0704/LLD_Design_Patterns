# LLD Design Patterns

This repository contains **Python implementations of common Low-Level Design (LLD) Design Patterns**.  

Each pattern is demonstrated through a small, focused problem to **understand its usage and implementation**.  

## Patterns Covered
| Category      | Patterns                                 |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Creational    | Singleton, Factory, Builder             |
| Structural    | Adapter, Facade, Decorator              |
| Behavioral    | Strategy, Observer, Chain of Responsibility |

## Purpose
- Learn and practice **object-oriented design principles**.  
- Serve as a reference for **interviews and future projects**.  

## Next Steps
- Add more problems and examples for each pattern.  
- Explore **complex scenarios** to strengthen practical understanding.  

## Usage
```bash
git clone https://github.com/anagha0704/LLD_Design_Patterns.git

Navigate to any pattern folder and run the Python files to see the examples in action.
