Problem Statement: Ice Cream Decorator

You are tasked with designing a system for an ice cream shop that allows customers to build their own ice cream orders. 
The shop sells different flavors of ice cream (like Vanilla, Chocolate, Strawberry), and customers can add various toppings (like Sprinkles, Nuts, Caramel, Chocolate Syrup, Whipped Cream, etc.).

The requirements are:
- Base Ice Cream Flavors should be represented as core objects (e.g., Vanilla, Chocolate).
- Toppings should be added dynamically to these ice creams without modifying the base classes.
- Each topping should add an extra description and extra cost to the base ice cream.
- The system should support any combination of toppings in any order.
- The solution should ensure flexibility and scalability for adding new toppings in the future.
