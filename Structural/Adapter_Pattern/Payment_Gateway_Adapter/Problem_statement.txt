Adapter Pattern: Payment Gateway Adapter

You are building an e-commerce application that processes payments.

The application expects all payment methods to follow a common interface:

class PaymentProcessor:
    def pay(amount: float):
        pass


You want to integrate two third-party payment gateways, each with their own APIs:

PayPal: send_payment(payment_amount)

Stripe: make_payment(total_amount)

The goal is to allow your application to process payments through PayPal or Stripe without changing the existing payment code.

Your task is to design an Adapter for each payment gateway so that both conform to the PaymentProcessor interface, enabling seamless usage in your app.


- PaymentProcessor
    + pay(amount)

    - TargetProcessor

- PayPal
    - make_payment(payment_amount)

- Stripe
    - send_payment(total_amount)

- PayPalAdapter
    - send()

- StripeAdapter
    - send()
