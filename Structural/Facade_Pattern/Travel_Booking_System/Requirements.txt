Travel Booking Facade Problem Statement

- A travel agency offers a system to book complete trips. A trip can include:

1. Flight Booking – select origin, destination, and flight class.

2. Hotel Booking – choose hotel, room type, and number of nights.

3. Car Rental – choose car type and rental duration.

Currently, each service has its own complex API with multiple steps:

FlightBookingSystem: check availability, reserve seat, confirm payment.

HotelBookingSystem: check room availability, reserve room, confirm payment.

CarRentalSystem: check car availability, reserve car, confirm payment.

A customer should be able to book a complete trip with a single call, without worrying about the internal complexities of each system.

- Implement separate classes for FlightBooking, HotelBooking, and CarRental subsystems with methods like bookFlight(), bookHotel(), and bookCar().

- Implement a TravelFacade class that provides a simplified method bookTrip() that:

    - Books a flight
    - Books a hotel
    - Books a rental car
    - Returns a summary of the complete trip booking
