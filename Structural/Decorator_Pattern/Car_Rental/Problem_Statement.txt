Decorator Pattern: Car Rental System

You are designing a Car Rental System. 
A customer can rent a basic car, but they may add extra features dynamically:

- GPS Navigation

- Child Seat

- Insurance Coverage

- Roadside Assistance

Each feature should be a decorator that adds extra cost and description to the base rental.

For example:

A plain car costs $50/day.

Adding GPS makes it $65/day.

Adding GPS + Insurance makes it $95/day.

The system should allow combining features without altering the base car class.
