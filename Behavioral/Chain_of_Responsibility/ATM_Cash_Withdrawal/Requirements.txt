ATM Cash Withdrawal Problem Statement

An ATM machine dispenses cash in denominations of $100, $50, $20, and $10.
When a user requests a withdrawal, the ATM should dispense the highest possible denominations first, then pass the remainder down the chain.

For example:

Request = $280 → 2 × $100, 1 × $50, 1 × $20, 1 × $10

Request = $90 → 1 × $50, 2 × $20

Request = $30 → 1 × $20, 1 × $10

Requirements

Implement a Handler interface / abstract class with a method dispense(amount) that processes part of the request and passes the remainder to the next handler.

Create concrete handlers:

Dollar100Dispenser

Dollar50Dispenser

Dollar20Dispenser

Dollar10Dispenser

Chain them together:

$100 -> $50 -> $20 -> $10

A ATMDispenser (client) will pass the withdrawal request to the first handler ($100).

Each handler checks how many notes of its denomination fit into the remaining amount, dispenses them, and forwards the leftover amount to the next handler.

If an amount not divisible by 10 is entered (like $125), the ATM should reject the request.
