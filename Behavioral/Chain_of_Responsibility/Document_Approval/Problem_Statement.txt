Problem Statement: Document Approval System

You are designing a Document Approval System for a company.

Documents need to go through different levels of approval based on their type and importance:

Team Lead – Can approve low-priority documents (e.g., internal memos).

Department Manager – Can approve medium-priority documents (e.g., budget requests).

Director – Can approve high-priority documents (e.g., policy changes, large expenditures).

Each approver should handle the document if it’s within their authority, otherwise pass it to the next approver in the chain. 
The system should allow adding more approvers later without modifying existing ones.

- Document
    - id: str
    - categoty: str

    + next_handler(handler):  => self.next = handler
    + approval()

    - Team Lead

    - handler = Team_lead()
    - dept = Department()
    - director = Director()

    - h = handler.next_handler(dept)
    - d = dept.next_handler(h)

    - h.approval():
