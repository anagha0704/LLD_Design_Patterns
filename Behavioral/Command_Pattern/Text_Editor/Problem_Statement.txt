Command Pattern: Text Editor

You are designing a Text Editor system with Undo/Redo functionality.

The editor supports the following operations:

WriteText – Append text at the end of the document.

DeleteText – Delete the last n characters.

CopyText – Copy a portion of the text.

PasteText – Paste previously copied text.

Requirements:

Each operation should be encapsulated as a Command object.

The editor should keep track of executed commands so that Undo and Redo can be performed.

The system should be easily extendable (e.g., adding a Find & Replace command later should not affect existing code).

****** Initial Solution

- Command
    + execute()
    + undo()
    + redo()

    - WriteText
    - DeleteText
    - CopyText
    - PasteText

- Document                  # (Receiver)
    + context: str

- Editor                    # (Invoker)
    + set_command(commmand: Command)
    + execute()->command.execute()
    + undo()

- Client
    - editor.set_command(WriteText)
    - editor.execute()
