An e-commerce platform allows users to pay for their orders using different payment methods.
Currently, the platform supports:

Credit Card – user provides card number, expiry date, and CVV.

PayPal – user logs in to their PayPal account to authorize payment.

Cryptocurrency – user sends crypto from their wallet.

The client code should be able to switch payment strategies dynamically:
