Problem Statement: Traffic Light Monitoring System

You are designing a Traffic Light Monitoring System for a smart city.
The cityâ€™s Central Traffic Controller (CTC) oversees multiple intersections, each with its own traffic light.

Whenever a traffic light changes its state (e.g., from RED â†’ GREEN, GREEN â†’ YELLOW, etc.), 
all registered observers (such as the CTC, Emergency Response System, and Traffic Data Logger) must be notified automatically.

This ensures:

The CTC can coordinate other nearby intersections to prevent congestion.

The Emergency Response System can prioritize certain routes for ambulances.

The Traffic Data Logger can record the changes for analytics.

ðŸ§  Requirements

TrafficLight (Subject)

Maintains its current state (RED, YELLOW, GREEN).

Allows observers to register and unregister.

Notifies all observers whenever the light changes.

Observer Interface

Each observer implements an update(state) method that receives the new light state.

Concrete Observers

CentralTrafficController â†’ adjusts timing for nearby intersections.

EmergencyResponseSystem â†’ checks if emergency vehicles are waiting.

TrafficDataLogger â†’ records every state change for analytics.

Demo Scenario

Create one TrafficLight object.

Register all three observers.

Simulate a few state changes (RED â†’ GREEN â†’ YELLOW â†’ RED) and observe how each observer reacts.
