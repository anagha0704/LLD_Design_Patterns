Problem Statement: Stock Market Ticker

You are designing a Stock Market Ticker system that pushes live stock price updates to multiple subscribers.

Requirements:

StockData (Subject)

Maintains the latest stock prices (e.g., AAPL, GOOG, TSLA).

Allows observers to subscribe and unsubscribe.

Notifies all registered observers whenever stock prices are updated.

Observers

MobileApp → displays the stock price in a simple text format.

TradingBot → reacts to price changes (e.g., prints “BUY” if price falls below threshold, “SELL” if it rises above).

AnalyticsDashboard → shows percentage changes in stock prices.

Client Code

Should demonstrate:

Subscribing different observers.

Updating stock prices (simulate price feed).

Observers automatically reacting to updates.
