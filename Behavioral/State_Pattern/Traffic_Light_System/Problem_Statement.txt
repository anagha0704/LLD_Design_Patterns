🚦 Problem Statement: Traffic Light System using the State Pattern

You are tasked with designing a Traffic Light Control System for a busy intersection. 
The traffic light cycles through three states — Red, Green, and Yellow — each representing a different behavior.

Your goal is to implement this system using the State Design Pattern, 
where each light state encapsulates its own behavior and defines the transition to the next state.

🎯 Requirements

The system should have three states:

Red Light State

Display: “RED — Stop!”

Next state: Green

Green Light State

Display: “GREEN — Go!”

Next state: Yellow

Yellow Light State

Display: “YELLOW — Slow down!”

Next state: Red

There should be a TrafficLightContext class that:

Holds the current state.

Delegates the behavior to the current state.

Allows state transitions (handled by the current state itself).

You should be able to:

Initialize the light in Red state.

Call a method like next_state() or change() to move to the next state.

Continuously loop through states in order (Red → Green → Yellow → Red → ...).
