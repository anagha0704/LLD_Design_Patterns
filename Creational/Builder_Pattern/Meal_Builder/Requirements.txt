Meal Builder Problem Statement üçîü•§üçü

A restaurant offers customizable meal combos.
A meal can include:

Main item (e.g., Burger, Sandwich, Wrap)

Side item (e.g., Fries, Salad, Nuggets)

Drink (e.g., Coke, Juice, Water)

Dessert (e.g., Ice Cream, Brownie)

Not all meals need to include everything. For example:

A Kids Meal may include: Burger + Fries + Juice.

A Combo Meal may include: Sandwich + Fries + Coke + Ice Cream.

A Healthy Meal may include: Wrap + Salad + Water.

The restaurant wants a flexible way to construct different types of meals without having to create a separate class for each type of meal.

Requirements

Create a Meal class with attributes: mainItem, sideItem, drink, dessert.

Implement a MealBuilder that allows step-by-step construction of a meal (e.g., withMainItem("Burger"), withDrink("Coke")).

Provide a build() method that returns the final Meal object.

Optionally, create a Director class to quickly build predefined meals like KidsMeal, ComboMeal, HealthyMeal.
