Builder Pattern: Meal Plan Generator

You are tasked with designing a Meal Plan Generator for a nutrition app. 
Each meal plan consists of several optional components:

Main Dish (e.g., chicken, pasta, salad)

Side Dish (e.g., fries, soup, vegetables)

Drink (e.g., water, soda, juice)

Dessert (e.g., cake, ice cream, fruit)

Not every meal plan requires all components (e.g., a healthy plan might skip dessert, a diet plan might only allow water as a drink).

Your goal is to build a flexible system where different meal plans can be created step by step, without forcing all components. 
The system should allow easy extension if new meal types are added in the future.
