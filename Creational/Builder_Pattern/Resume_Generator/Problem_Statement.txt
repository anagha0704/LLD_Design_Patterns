Problem Statement: Resume Generator

You are building a system to generate resumes for candidates.

A resume can have the following sections (but not all are mandatory):

Personal Information (name, email, phone) â€“ required

Education (multiple entries possible)

Work Experience (multiple entries possible)

Projects (multiple entries possible)

Skills (list)

Certifications (optional)

Different candidates may want to include different sections 
(e.g., a fresher may skip Work Experience, while an experienced professional may skip Projects).

The system should allow constructing a customized resume step by step, and finally "build" the complete resume.
