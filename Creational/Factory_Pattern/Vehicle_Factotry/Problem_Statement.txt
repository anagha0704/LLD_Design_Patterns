Problem Statement: Vehicle Factory

You are building a transport booking system. The system needs to support multiple types of vehicles:

- Car

- Bike

- Truck

Each vehicle should have a method deliver() that prints:

"Delivering by Car"

"Delivering by Bike"

"Delivering by Truck"

The client must not instantiate vehicles directly. 
Instead, they request them through a VehicleFactory, which decides which object to return based on the input string ("CAR", "BIKE", "TRUCK").

***** Initial Design

- Vehicles
    + deliver()

    - Car
    - Bike
    - Truck

- Factory
    + request_vehicle(): pass

    - CarFactory
        + request_Vehicle()
    
    - TruckFactory
        + request_Vehicle()
    
    - BikeFactory
        + request_Vehicle()

-  client
    - car = CarFactory()
    - vehicle = car.request_Vehicle()
    - vehicle.deliver()

---- Delegates creatiob responsibility to subclasses.
